# Jerk Chicken

The term _jerk_ comes from the 18th century Latin American Spanish verb _charquear_, and the word has evolved to define the act of poking holes in meat so that spices can permeate the entire cut of meat. Jamaicans who have mastered the art of jerk chicken are like sorcerers who refuse to hand over their ancient rituals. But the few who have, have taught us that there a few tricks to creating a proper jerk chicken - an overnight marinade in citrus, fiery Scotch Bonnet peppers and thyme; a dry rub applied before smoking the chicken that consists of a number of spices including Scotch Bonnets, ground allspice, and green onions; and smoking the meat over allspice wood (refered to as pimento on the island). You probably won't be able to find allspice wood, so we'll recommend using a combination of mesquite and allspice berries. 

So turn your smoker on, pop open a Red Stripe, crank up Toots and the Maytals, and that smell of allspice smoke is gonna make you feel like you're on the island.

## Directions

### Prep the Chicken

Using a cleaver, halve each chicken along the backbone. Once separated, halve each chicken half, ensuring to keep the thigh whole and the breast whole. Poke holes in the chicken pieces to allow the marinade to seep in.

### Grind the spices

Pulverize the berries and black peppercorns in a spice grinder. Make sure to keep the marinade and rub ingredients separate.

### Vegemighty

Using food preparation gloves, destem and chop the peppers. If you don't use gloves, you may regret your life for the next 36 hours.

Chop the green onions. Peel and chop the garlic. Destem the thyme sprigs. 

Make sure to keep the marinade and rub ingredients separate.

### Merrynade

Juice the limes. Mix the orange juice, vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce and lime juice together.

Place the liquid, chopped and pulverized spices, and remaining sugar and spices in a food processor or blender and process until well mixed. 

Taste the marinade. Add salt or additional Scotch Bonnet peppers if needed.

### Take an overnight bath

Put on your food preparation gloves. Place the chicken in large glass bowls or baking dishes. Cover the chicken with the marinade, and work the marinade into the chicken by hand. Cover the containers with plastic wrap, and let sit in the fridge overnight.

### Prep the Rub

Juice the limes. Add the lime juice, green onions, Scotch Bonnet peppers, salt, mace, ground allspice and ground black peppercorns in a food processor or blender and process until well mixed. You can do this step either the day before or the day of.

### Rub it in why don't ya, jerk!

The next day, take the chicken pieces out of the marinade and pat them dry with paper towels. Coat the individual chicken pieces with the jerk rub. There will be some rub left over for dipping and sweating.

### Smoke it

Use a combination of mesquite and allspice berries for smoking. Smoke the chicken for around 6 hours at 200째F / 93째C until the internal temperature reaches 165째F / 74째C.

### Yah Mon!

Serve as is, or quickly toss them on the grill to add a bit of char. You can serve jerk chicken up with sides of fried plantains, and beans and rice.
