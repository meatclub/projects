Meat projects for your meat club to fork, make, and enjoy.

This is the public repo for all meat projects that we've published via the <a href="https://meatclub.in/">Meat Club</a> site.

All meat projects on the website include photos for every project step, as well as a recipe that accompanies or utilizes the meat project (e.g. a gumbo recipe for your homemade Andouille).

Some meat projects are only available from this repo. We may officially publish them on the website at a future date.

Give us a shout at <a href="https://twitter.com/meatclubin">@meatclubin</a> if there's a particular recipe you'd like to see us publish in this repo.
