# Currywurst

Currywurst is a Berlin specialty that is made by grilling Knackwurst, slicing it, then slathering it with ketchup spiked with curry powder and paprika, and topping it with a dusting of curry powder. Currywurst sauce, or curry ketchup, was first created in Berlin in 1949 by Herta Heuwer, who obtained both curry powder and ketchup from British soliders after World War II. She opened a street stand to sell Currywurst to construction workers who were rebuilding the devastated city after the war.

We've been thinking about this recipe for a while, and asked ourselves, "What if the curry was _in_ the sausage!?!?" Crazy right? Well folks, here it is - our curry-laced knackwurst. Go get your curry on.
