# Currywurst

Currywurst is a Berlin specialty that is made by grilling Knackwurst, slicing it, then slathering it with ketchup spiked with curry powder and paprika, and topping it with a dusting of curry powder. Currywurst sauce, or curry ketchup, was first created in Berlin in 1949 by Herta Heuwer, who obtained both curry powder and ketchup from British soliders after World War II. She opened a street stand to sell Currywurst to construction workers who were rebuilding the devastated city after the war.

We've been thinking about this recipe for a while, and asked ourselves, "What if the curry was _in_ the sausage!?!?" Crazy right? Well folks, here it is - our curry-laced knackwurst. Go get your curry on.

## Overall Time

3 hours

## Preparation Time

3 hours

## Equipment Checklist

* Meat grinder
* Sausage stuffer

## Ingredients

* 7 lbs. stew beef
* 3 lbs. pork shoulder
* ¼ cup kosher salt
* 2 tbsp. white peppercorns
* 10 cloves garlic
* 2 tbsp. paprika
* 1 tbsp. cumin seeds, toasted
* 1 tbsp. cardamom pods, toasted
* 1 tbsp. coriander seeds, toasted
* 2 tbsp. ground turmeric
* 1 tbsp. dry mustard
* 1 tsp. cayenne 
* 2 tsp. mace
* 2 cups Berliner Weisse beer

### For Casing

* 4 cups water
* 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar
* 20 ft. hog casing

If you're buying the meat pre-ground from the butcher, ask them to coarsely grind the meat.

## Directions

### Let's Roll 

Place 3 large mixing bowls and the meat grinder attachment in the freezer around 15 minutes before use. Keeping the equipment cold will help the grinding move quickly.

Measure out 2 cups beer and place in the fridge to keep it cold. Measure out the remaining ingredients of your shopping list, so that they are ready to work with in the subsequent steps.

### Prepare the Casing

At least 30 minutes before using the casing:

Rinse the casing well. Add 4 cups water and 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar to a bowl. Place the casing in the water / vinegar mixture.

### Prepare the Meats

Chop the pork shoulder and pork belly into 1-inch chunks, and place them in the chilled mixing bowls.

Place each bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes to keep the meat as cold as possible through the preparation steps.

### Grind 'er Up

Prepare the meat grinder with the large die. 

Mince the garlic. Mix the minced garlic in with the diced meats. 

Grind the meat and garlic mixture through the grinder and allow to fall into a chilled mixing bowl.

### Currytastic

In a small skillet, toast the cardamom pods until lightly brown. When finished remove the,, then toast the coriander seeds. And finally, remove them and toast the cumin seeds. Toasting them separately allows you to ensure the right doneness for each type of seed and pod.

Place the toasted seeds and pods along with the white peppercorns in a blender and pulverize them.

### Whisk 

Add all of the spices into the beer. This will allow the flavors from each of the spices to expand throughtout the liquid, which will help the flavors to permeate the meat.

### Mix 'er Up

Pour the spice mixture into the bowl of ground meat.

Put on some food preparation gloves and mix the spice mixture into the ground meat until the meat is uniformly coated with the spice mixture.

Place the meat mixture back in the freezer while while taste testing.

### Taste Test

Grab a handful of the meat mixture, form it into a small patty, and fry it up in a pan. Taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed.

Meanwhile, replace the remaining meat mixture in the freezer to keep it cold.

### Stuff That Casing

Prepare the sausage stuffer for use. Press the meat through the stuffer until the ground meat just barely pokes through the end of the spout.  

Push the open end of the hog casing over the end of the stuffer, and continue to push the casing onto the stuffer until you reach the end of the casing. Tie a knot at the end of the casing.

Stuff the sausage into the hog casings and wrap the sausage into a long coil. Once finished, tie off the other end of the sausage. Twist the sausage into links every 6 inches.

### Superfly

Wrap the cased sausage links in butcher paper, or place in sealable freezer storage bags. Using a Sharpie, label each package __Currywurst: made {{current_date}}__.

Refrigerate for at least 24 hours before consuming, to allow the flavors to mingle. Place in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or the freezer for up to 1 month.

Cook the Currywurst to a temperature of 150°F / 65°C before consuming it. Do it like the Berliners do - slice it up, sprinkle curry powder over top, serve it with a side of curried ketchup and toothpicks.
